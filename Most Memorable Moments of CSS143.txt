CSS 143 Most Memorable Moments

- One of the more prominent memorable moments was when you introduced us to ice racing
  While also being able to apply your hobby to coding in terms of general performance
  And how certain codes are better than others for certain situations.

- Another prominent yet memorable moment was when you introduced us to J-Unit it's an 
  Amazing testing program and I don't think that I would have ever been able to find 
  Something like it on my own.

- Collaborating with my peers was certainly memorable especially when it came to the in
  Class assignments, as there were rare times in which I would be a little bit uncertain
  About what was said and my peers would often be able to explain it to me.

- The first day when you said that there was a class discord I was a bit shocked, as 
  I can't think of a single professor besides you who actually had an external source  
  through which we could contact you and almost always get a response within a few 
  minutes.

- One final memorable moment that I had in this class was in all honesty the overall
  Flow of it as last quarter during my CSS142 class the professor while confident in her
  Teaching had a schedule that didn't exactly flow well together in the introduction of
  Certain programming subjects and terms, so the overall flow that you had with your 
  schedule is something that I will probably remember as well.

- I will also remember during one of the lectures when you let one of the students sleep
  Since you understand that we sometimes have to make sacrifices with sleep in order to
  Finish things, as I'm pretty sure any other professor would have made it their goal
  To wake up the student in some way and embarrass them. 

- The last memorable moment from CSS143 that I will probably remember for some time from 
  This class is when you made the effort to actually move classes online in response 
  To concerns about the virus, plus the fact that you were able to do those online classes
  With the same amount of clearness that you would normally have during the normal 
  lectures.
